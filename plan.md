# Broad overview of what I'm actually doing/decisions

- We have limited the user input by using a select input
  **IMPLEMENT THE SELECT INPUT**

- We return all of the data to the frontend
  - we loosely categorize and group the data together and display that related data together in a container.
    - for example, translations of the official & common name can be grouped together
      **CATEGORIZE AND GROUP DATA**
